Has your relationship been stuck in the same unhealthy patterns that cause you and your spouse to drift apart and feel unseen, unheard, and abandoned? Does your relationship seem like a roommate marriage without genuine emotional connection or passion? Do you struggle with communication breakdown, lost intimacy, emotional disconnection, and loneliness in marriage?

According to research, couples typically [wait six years before seeking treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33411353/#:~:text=A%20widely%20cited%20but%20poorly,have%20poor%20prospects%20for%20recovery.), which allows their problems to build up and makes healing and rekindling more difficult.

## Why Emotionally Focused Therapy for Couples?

Emotionally focused therapy for couples takes a structured and solution-oriented approach to overcoming relationship issues and developing healthier behavior patterns. **EFT** focuses on attachment in adult relationships, aiming to help couples turn toward each other more frequently and identify and change steps in their relationship dance â€“ dominant emotional responses in situations of distress.

## How Can EFT Help You Build A Strong Relationship That Works?

EFT focuses on emotions and patterns in the relationship, encouraging both partners to become more available, vulnerable, and emotionally connected. It provides a secure environment where you and your partner may feel comfortable being vulnerable, revealing your deepest feelings, and opening up about what you truly need to feel seen, heard, and validated. This communication shift will eventually result in the improvement of other aspects of your relationship, your other relationships, and your overall well-being.

### 1. EFT Can Help You Understand Your Emotional Responses 

How do you reach out to your spouse when you feel hurt, upset, or insecure? Do you get furious, lash out at your partner, or become passive-aggressive? Do you shut down, suppress your feelings, and avoid bringing up the matter because you don't want to make things worse? Do you blame yourself, believing that you're not good enough?

While we cannot avoid conflicts and disagreements in our relationships, knowing how to express your feelings and reach out to your partner can make a significant difference. An EFT therapist can help you understand your main patterns and learn how to respond to each other with more empathy and care.
