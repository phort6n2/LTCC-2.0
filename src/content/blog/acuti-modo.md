Does your relationship seem like a roommate marriage without genuine emotional connection or passion?

## Why Emotionally Focused Therapy for Couples?

Emotionally focused therapy for couples takes a structured and solution-oriented approach to overcoming relationship issues and developing healthier behavior patterns. **EFT** focuses on attachment in adult relationships, aiming to help couples turn toward each other more frequently and identify and change steps in their relationship dance â€“ dominant emotional responses in situations of distress.

## How Can EFT Help You Build A Strong Relationship That Works?

EFT focuses on emotions and patterns in the relationship, encouraging both partners to become more available, vulnerable, and emotionally connected. It provides a secure environment where you and your partner may feel comfortable being vulnerable, revealing your deepest feelings, and opening up about what you truly need to feel seen, heard, and validated. This communication shift will eventually result in the improvement of other aspects of your relationship, your other relationships, and your overall well-being.

### 1. EFT Can Help You Understand Your Emotional Responses 

How do you reach out to your spouse when you feel hurt, upset, or insecure? Do you get furious, lash out at your partner, or become passive-aggressive? Do you shut down, suppress your feelings, and avoid bringing up the matter because you don't want to make things worse? Do you blame yourself, believing that you're not good enough?

While we cannot avoid conflicts and disagreements in our relationships, knowing how to express your feelings and reach out to your partner can make a significant difference. An EFT therapist can help you understand your main patterns and learn how to respond to each other with more empathy and care.

### 2. EFT Can Improve Your Communication

Communication breakdown is one of the significant reasons that brings couples to counseling because communication skills are something we must constantly work on. Marriage counseling can help you develop positive communication strategies and get past communication breakdowns.

For example, if your partner says or does something that hurts your feelings, avoid blaming and accusing them. Talk to them without passing judgment and show your curiosity by saying something like, "What is going on for you? How do you feel right now? I know you're a wonderful person who would never hurt me. But something inside you must be causing you to say or behave in such a way."

When you reframe a stressful situation this way, you are slowing your cycle and attempting to understand rather than becoming reactive, which usually leads to positive communication outcomes.
