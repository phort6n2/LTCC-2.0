description: Self-sabotage refers to all the patterns of behavior, beliefs, and thoughts that prevent you from achieving your goals, evolving, and reaching your full potential. While everyone sometimes feels insecure or inadequate, when these feelings and beliefs are persistent or deeply ingrained, they may significantly impact your well-being and work against your best interests.

# Menifee: California's Fastest Growing City and the Need for Social Services

Menifee, California, is a city on the rise. As one of the fastest-growing cities in California, it has attracted countless new residents seeking a fresh start. With its scenic landscapes and community spirit, Menifee offers a welcoming environment. However, as the population grows, the availability of social services has struggled to keep pace, leaving many residents in need of support. This is where Lakes Therapy and Counseling Center steps in to make a difference.

We understand that many new residents commute to major cities like Los Angeles and San Diego, often finding it challenging to balance busy schedules with the need for mental health and relationship support. That's why we offer convenient Saturday sessions and video counseling options to ensure that accessing help is as easy and flexible as possible.

## Understanding Relationship Struggles

Relationships can be complicated. Statistics show that nearly **50% of marriages end in divorce** in the United States. Many couples argue and fight, with common reasons including:

- **Communication Issues**: A lack of effective communication can lead to misunderstandings and conflict.
- **Financial Stress**: Money disagreements are a leading cause of tension within relationships.
- **Intimacy and Affection**: A decline in emotional or physical connection often results in frustration and resentment.
- **Different Life Goals**: Sometimes, couples grow apart as individual aspirations evolve.

It's vital to recognize the importance of seeking help early. Couples who reach out for support sooner often experience faster and more effective resolutions to their issues. Much like regular car maintenance prevents costly repairs down the line, investing time in relationship maintenance can protect a partnership from the wear and tear of conflict. Just as a car runs more smoothly when it is well taken care of, so too do relationships flourish when nurtured through open communication and guidance.

At Lakes Therapy and Counseling, we offer weekly sessions priced at $200, a competitive rate compared to surrounding areas, even though we do not accept insurance. Our approach typically spans 3-6 months of either weekly or bi-weekly sessions, allowing couples to develop the tools they need for lasting change.
