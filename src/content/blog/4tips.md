Are you constantly feeling like you're in a rut? Do you have trouble reaching your goals, making positive changes, feeling happy with yourself, or enjoying your relationships? You might struggle to find passion and purpose in life and meaningfully connect with others or believe you are undeserving of love, happiness, or success.

If this resonates with you, you may unknowingly get in our way with self-sabotage.

## What is Self-Sabotage?

Self-sabotage refers to all the patterns of behavior, beliefs, and thoughts that prevent you from achieving your goals, evolving, and reaching your full potential. While everyone sometimes feels insecure or inadequate, when these feelings and beliefs are persistent or deeply ingrained, they may significantly impact your well-being and work against your best interests.

## Root Causes of Self-Sabotage

Why do we sometimes get in our own way? Sometimes, the way we think and act that holds us back may be traced back to our childhood and upbringing. Many children from families with insecure attachments absorb the belief that they're not intelligent, good, or valuable enough, becoming adults who feel insecure and lack confidence.

The beliefs we internalize as children can really linger with us, causing us to feel like we don't deserve love, happiness, or success. They can trigger anxiety and make us feel like failures and worthless, getting in the way of our success and happiness.

Also, when we are afraid of failure, we may use certain types of self-sabotage that provide a false or temporary sense of control. For example, a fear of making mistakes and failure at work may cause you to rewrite the report multiple times because you feel it's imperfect. Ultimately, your perfectionism may cause you to miss deadlines or not deliver the work at all.

## How Self-Sabotage Affects Your Potential and Personal Growth

Self-sabotage can keep you trapped in a cycle of negative behaviors and thoughts that keep you from being your best authentic self. Self-sabotage can mess with your self-perception and confidence, making you believe you are limited and incapable of achieving your goals. Doubting your skills can keep you from taking chances, getting out of your comfort zone, and achieving your dreams. Finally, engaging in self-destructive habits can harm your health and well-being, strain your relationships, and stop you from experiencing true fulfillment in life.

## 4 Powerful Ways to Overcome Self-Sabotage

When we constantly judge ourselves and strive for perfection, this can take a toll on our self-esteem and well-being. But you can break that cycle of self-sabotage and actually learn to get unstuck. Here's how you do it.

### 1. Recognize Self-Sabotaging Behaviors

Identifying and acknowledging self-sabotaging behaviors, beliefs, and thoughts is the first step toward addressing self-sabotage. By becoming aware of unhelpful patterns that don't serve you, you can begin to work on strategies to shift your mindset and overcome self-limiting tendencies.

Here are the most common behaviors that hinder our success and personal growth.

#### Self-Limiting Beliefs and Negative Self-Talk 

Self-sabotage is often rooted in negative self-talk about your own worth, skills, and competence. When you constantly criticize yourself and expect failure, it can diminish your confidence and motivation, so you may give up easily and stay stuck in unproductive patterns. For example, you may be telling yourself that you don't have enough skills and knowledge to apply for a job promotion, so you don't even try despite your knowledge and experience.

#### Imposter Syndrome

Do you doubt your skills and accomplishments, seeing yourself as incompetent or incapable? Do you fear that others will see you as a fraud, assigning your success to outside factors such as luck or chance? Imposter syndrome can make it difficult to explore new opportunities and make changes due to fear of exposure and failure.
