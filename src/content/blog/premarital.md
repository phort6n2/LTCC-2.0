Premarital counseling is a form of couples therapy that helps couples get ready for marriage by strengthening the foundation of their relationship before tying the knot. 
Marriage is a significant life milestone that is built on love, trust, and a lifetime of cherished moments. However, like any important pursuit in life, maintaining a fulfilling marriage needs thoughtful preparation, consistent effort, and continuous commitment.
Premarital counseling, or premarital therapy, can help you prepare for marriage by clarifying your expectations, strengthening your emotional bond, and learning the skills to lay the framework for a healthy marriage.

## Reasons to Attend Premarital Counseling

Studies show that premarital counseling can improve relationship quality and increase marriage success. Couples might benefit from premarital therapy by exploring and discussing various aspects of their relationship, such as expectations, communication, needs, values, goals, and potential challenges.
So, your reasons for seeking premarital counseling may include some of the following.

### Strengthening Emotional Connection 

Your therapist may help you deepen your emotional connection and intimacy by developing skills to:

- tune into each other's feelings
- Deal with difficult emotions
- turn to each other's bids for connection
- set healthy boundaries
- be aware of one another's sexual needs.  

### Learning Healthy Communication Strategies

Premarital counseling may be a safe place to practice effective communication skills, openly express your thoughts, feelings, and concerns, actively listen, and respectfully address conflicts. 
Your counselor can encourage you to explore each other's love languages, learn how to compromise and cooperate, and openly discuss significant topics such as having children, infertility, moving to another city, state, or country, career change, financial issues, etc. 

### Exploring and Discussing Expectations

Your therapist can help you freely share your own expectations, beliefs, values, and marriage goals to ensure you and your partner are on the same page and guarantee consistency and understanding.

### Establishing Common Goals

Having a common values and goals in a marriage is crucial, even though it is necessary to maintain your individuality and independence after marriage. Premarital counseling may also help you set mutual future goals and create strategies for reaching them, whether your careers, children, or finances.

### Addressing Potential Challenges

Your therapist can help you identify any potential issues in your marriage, like how you will interact with each other, make decisions, navigate in-law issues, raise children, or handle finances before these issues pile up. The therapist may also help you create strategies to overcome challenges and increase your resilience.

### Practicing Conflict Resolution

Premarital counseling can provide you with practical strategies to address and resolve conflicts, repair after arguments, and express your needs and feelings in a way that promotes connection and closeness. 

### Understanding Each Other's Background

The patterns we learn in our families of origin impact our behavior, beliefs, values, and expectations. Different attachment types, upbringing, or childhood trauma might cause problems in our adult relationships.
Premarital counseling may be a secure place to learn about each other's families of origin and understand how your learned patterns may affect your marriage.

### Preventing Years in Therapy or Divorce

You may avoid years of marriage therapy or divorce by addressing emotional baggage from prior relationships, marriages, or trauma during premarital counseling. The counselor can assist you in identifying and addressing unhealthy behavior patterns, past wounds, and insecure attachment styles that may prevent you from building a healthy marriage. 

## EFT-Based Premarital Counseling

Emotionally focused therapy (EFT), developed by Dr. Sue Johnson, is a well-established and evidence-based approach to couples therapy. EFT is based on attachment theory, which holds that strong attachment bonds are essential for our emotional well-being. 

### Who Can Benefit from EFT Premarital Counseling?

According to attachment theory, people are wired to seek emotional connection. EFT aims to help couples recognize and understand their emotional needs and responses to create secure attachment in their relationships.

#### Communication Issues

EFT-based premarital counseling can benefit couples who struggle with effective communication, helping them address these issues before they escalate. In addition, emotionally focused therapy provides tools and strategies to increase empathy and enhance communication skills. 

#### Conflicts

EFT premarital counseling can provide couples practical skills to navigate difficult conversations and resolve conflicts. 
Every relationship or marriage experiences conflict. But how you manage them will either make your marriage stronger or it will break it. Learning how to recover after arguments is essential for a successful marriage, not trying to avoid them. 

EFT premarital counseling can help you develop strategies to recover and reconnect after arguments, recognize and express your emotions, pay attention to your partner's feelings, and understand their perspective.

#### Different Attachment Styles

Couples with different attachment styles can learn to navigate their different needs and behavior patterns in the safe settings of premarital therapy. 

#### Attachment Wounds and Past Trauma 

Individuals with unresolved childhood trauma or attachment wounds often carry these issues into their adult relationships. EFT premarital counseling can be particularly beneficial for these people, helping them unpack their past hurts and heal from them.
